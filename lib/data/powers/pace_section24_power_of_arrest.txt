Use the mnemonic COPPLANED to help remember at a high level, the reason for arrest:

  - Child/Vunerable Person
  - Obstruction of highway
  - Prevent physical injury
  - Public decency
  - Loss/Damage
  - Address (verified)
  - Name (verified)
  - Effective & prompt investigation
  - Disappearance of suspect

However it is worth reading the detail list at: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24
